Pokemon/Tem Tem Type Checker:
	Input a pokemon name and it will give you it's weaknesses and strengths.
	Require DB for all the pokemon and a "Type lookup function" for getting strengths/weaknesses.
	800+ pokemon means a heavy DB. Possibility for error. because of possible exceptions..
	Tem Tem would be smaller. Alpha build is around 70? release will be 160. but small amount of data..


A.I. Image classifier:
	Take a picture and A.I. Identifies what it sees in the picture,
	Would have to train an image classifier then scale it down and import it into the app, or weblink it.
	Might not be enough time/ would need to be coded in multiple languages
